# Fan-Control-System
Project for Microprocessor course BITS-Pilani
	This repository holds the code for Fan Control System which developed as a simulation on _Proteus_ Simulation tool.

## Problem Statement
	Develop a fan system where in a user can
		1. Start/Stop fan via key press
		2. Increase/Decrease Fan speed via key press
		3. Set the Fan to auto mode and set timer for auto shutdown

	This project uses components like
		+ Intel 8086 Microprocessor
		+ 8255 I/O Ports
		+ 74LS138 Demultiplexer
		+ 74LS373 and 74LS245 Latches and Buffers
		+ 2732 - 4Kb ROMS
		+ 6116 - 2Kb RAMS
		+ Matrix Keyboard
		+ DC Motor

Code is written in assembly language and compiled via _EMU8086_

Project was done in a team effort by
